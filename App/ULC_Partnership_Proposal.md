**Subject options (pick one):**
- Integrating Ukrainian Lessons Podcast into [YourApp]: culture-first learning at scale  
- Proposal: co-branded **Ukrainian Culture Starter** powered by UkrainianLessons.com  
- Partnership idea: turn your podcast into interactive lessons inside [YourApp]

**Body:**

Hi Anna and the UkrainianLessons.com team,

I’m [Your Name], founder of **[YourApp]**, a language + culture learning app focused on Ukrainian. We admire your work—your podcast and lesson library already do the most important thing: bring **real Ukrainian voices and culture** into learners’ daily lives.

**Proposal (pilot, low-lift for your team):**  
We’d like to embed a curated set of your podcast episodes (A1–B1) **inside [YourApp]** with:
- In‑app audio player + time‑synced transcript (UA/EN toggle)  
- Auto‑generated vocab cards and 3–5 comprehension checks per episode  
- Short culture notes and a weekly “Culture Drop” tile  
- Co‑branding: **“Powered by UkrainianLessons.com”**

**Why it helps you**
- Reach new mobile learners who prefer structured, gamified practice  
- Clear attribution + analytics shared back with you (listens, completion, vocab learned)  
- Optional **bundle/affiliate** track for recurring revenue

**Pilot scope & timing**
- 10 episodes across A1–B1 → one co‑branded **“Ukrainian Culture Starter Pack”**  
- Build + QA in 4–6 weeks; publish as a channel in [YourApp]

**Commercial options**
- **Affiliate**: rev‑share on upgrades driven to ULC (starting at 20% CPA)  
- **License**: fixed monthly/content fee for in‑app use  
- **Bundle**: joint plan where [YourApp] Premium includes a ULC pack; rev split

If this is interesting, could we find 30 minutes next week to align on scope and the revenue model you prefer? If there’s someone else we should speak with, I’d appreciate an intro.

Дякую!

## 2) One‑Pager Proposal (copy into a deck/doc)

### Overview
Co‑brand a **“Ukrainian Culture Starter Pack”** that turns Ukrainian Lessons Podcast episodes into **interactive, measurable** lessons in **[YourApp]**.

### Goals
- Make **culture** the on‑ramp to sustained learning.  
- Increase **listening comprehension**, **speaking practice**, and **retention**.  
- Drive new **paid conversions** for both partners.

### Pilot Scope (10 episodes)
For each episode:
- Audio → **synced transcript** (UA/EN) → **glossary** → **3–5 quizzes** → **Culture Note** → **Shadowing** (pronunciation) → **SRS review**  
- Channel page: “**Powered by UkrainianLessons.com**” (logo + host bio).

### Integration Model (choose & expand)
- **Affiliate / Lead-funnel exchange:** In-app snippets; CTA → full ULC catalog.  
- **API-style embedding:** Stream audio & transcript via feed/API and layer interactivity.  
- **Co-branded track:** “ULC Beginner/Intermediate Series” inside [YourApp].  
- **Cross-subscription bundle:** SSO or referral token; joint monetization.  
- **Co-created new content:** e.g., “Cultural Fast Track” mini-series.

### Rights & Brand
- Rights: streaming within [YourApp]; transcripts displayed for enrolled users; no redistribution.  
- Attribution: ULC logo on channel & cards; host credit in episode headers.  
- Offline: optional on-device caching with DRM-like limits (time-bound).

### Measurement & Reporting
- **Engagement:** listens/minutes, completion rate, quiz score, saved words, shadowing minutes.  
- **Learning:** SRS retention, pronunciation score improvement.  
- **Growth:** CTA clicks → ULC; conversions (UTM/referral).  
- **Impact:** retention uplift vs. non‑ULC learners.

### Commercial Options
| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Affiliate** | % CPA on ULC conversions originating in [YourApp]. |
| **License** | Fixed fee per month/per episode bundle for in‑app use. |
| **Bundle** | Joint subscription tier; net revenue split after fees. |

### Timeline (illustrative)
- **Week 0–1:** Content selection + legal.  
- **Week 2–4:** Integration + QA.  
- **Week 5–6:** Soft launch + measurement.  
- **Week 7+:** Scale to 30–50 episodes if KPIs hit.

### Risks & Mitigations
- **Rights scope** → explicit license; offline caching limits; watermarking transcripts.  
- **Quality control** → shared editorial checklist; acceptance QA.  
- **Attribution** → unique deep links + UTMs; in‑app brand placement.

### Next Steps
1) Confirm 10 pilot episodes and preferred commercial model.  
2) Sign short‑form license/affiliate addendum.  
3) Kickoff meeting + shared Slack for content handoff.
