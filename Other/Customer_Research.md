# Why People Learn Languages in 2025 – and What It Means for Ukrainian Learning  
**Date:** 2025-10-31

## TL;DR (Key Findings)
- **Personal enrichment & culture top the list.** Recent 2025 surveys of U.S. learners show culture/curiosity and enjoyment/travel frequently outrank career goals as primary motivations.  
- **Career & education still matter.** For English and in formal settings, goals tied to **education** and **jobs** dominate; for many other languages, **connecting with people** and **fun** rank higher.  
- **“Fluency” is not one size fits all.** Most consumer learners aim for **functional conversational ability** aligned with their goals (travel, family, work) rather than academic-level mastery.  
- **Ukrainian in 2025:** Interest remains elevated versus pre‑2022 baselines. Motivations cluster around **solidarity & community**, **family/heritage**, **study/work with Ukraine’s reconstruction & civic life**, and **cultural engagement**. Policy signals (e.g., EU protections through 2027; Ukraine’s new multiple‑citizenship law with language testing) create **practical incentives** to learn Ukrainian.

## Part 1 — What language learners care about in 2025

### 1.1 Synthesized motivation landscape
Below is a synthesis of the most recent, large-scale public surveys and platform reports. Numbers are not directly comparable across rows (different samples & questions), but together they show a consistent pattern for 2024–2025.

| Source & geography | Sample/timeframe | Top motivations reported | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| **Drops (Kahoot!) – U.S.** | n=2,071 (Dec 2024; published Jan 2025) | **59%** motivated by passion for a culture/country/language; **42%** choose fun or travel over career as a driver; **75%** planned to learn a new language in 2025 | App-user sample; also highlights time constraints and speaking anxiety as major barriers |
| **Preply – U.S.** | n=2,502 (Dec 2023; updated Jul 2025) | **84%** cite *personal enrichment* as the reason for wanting to learn a language in 2024; **46%** mention *career advantage*; **39%** planned to learn a language in 2024 | Adds barriers: 70% report *time* as a hurdle; avg. plan ~3.5 hrs/week |
| **Duolingo Language Report – Global** | Millions of learners (Oct 2023–Sep 2024; published Dec 2024) | **English learners:** primarily *education / academic advancement*; **Spanish:** *connect with people*; **French:** *education* and *fun* | Also notes 35% of U.S. learners study English to *connect with people* |
| **Pearson – Global English (2024)** | Global test-taker & learner research | Social outcomes matter alongside work/education; about **one‑third** cite “making more friends/relationships” as a motivation | Focused on English; employer demand remains strong |
| **LTI (Language Testing International) – U.S. (2025)** | Editorial roundup (Jan 2025) | Career growth, travel convenience, personal development & cognitive benefits | Not a survey; useful framing for employer signaling |

**Interpretation:**  
- In **consumer app** contexts, **intrinsic** (enjoyment, culture) and **relational** (connecting with people) motives are **as strong or stronger** than instrumental ones (job credentials).  
- In **English‑learning** and **formal education** contexts, **education/career** stay dominant.  
- **Travel** remains a common practical driver, often folded into “fun/enjoyment.”  
- **Family/heritage** motivations are salient for **heritage speakers** and diaspora communities, with strong identity and wellbeing links.

### 1.2 Goal types (how “fluency” is defined by customers)
Most learners don’t mean “near‑native mastery” when they say *become fluent*. Based on 2024–2025 platform research and learner self‑reports, the goals cluster into four tiers:

1) **Survival / travel basics** — scripts, phrasebook chunks, menus, transport, politeness.  
2) **Conversational social fluency** — everyday topics, messaging, short calls, small talk; can connect with friends/family.  
3) **Work & study proficiency** — meetings, emails, reports, domain vocab; CEFR B2+ target.  
4) **Academic / professional mastery** — lectures, research, formal writing; C1–C2.

**Implication for product:** Let learners **declare their tier** and personalize paths to that competency, not an abstract notion of “fluency.”

## Part 2 — Ukrainian-specific language learning in 2025

### 2.1 Demand signals & context
- **Sustained post‑2022 interest.** The 2023 Duolingo report documented a unique pattern for **Ukrainian**: a large 2022 spike (solidarity) followed by steady 2023 demand; in 2023 the **U.S., U.K., Poland, Russia, and Ukraine** had the most learners of Ukrainian, and **37%** of *Ukrainian learners* said their goal was to **connect with people** (considerably higher than for English/French) — a distinctively **community‑driven** profile.  
- **Language shift inside Ukraine (2024–2025).** Independent polls show daily use of **Ukrainian rising into the mid‑60s to high‑60s %** of the population (from ~53% in 2022). This matters for learners who engage with Ukrainian media, communities, and institutions.  
- **Education & policy drivers.**  
  - The **EU** proposed extending **temporary protection for Ukrainians to March 2027**, indicating sustained cross‑border schooling and mixed-language households.  
  - **Poland (2025):** Ukrainian approved as a **second foreign language** option for 7th–8th graders — expanding exposure among non‑Ukrainians.  
  - **U.K. (2025):** Public discussion of **re‑introducing a Ukrainian GCSE** for refugee and diaspora students.  
  - **Ukraine (2025):** New **multiple‑citizenship law** requires a **Ukrainian language (plus history/constitution) test** for foreign applicants — a concrete incentive for partners/spouses, volunteers, and long‑term residents.  
- **Where to find learners:** University programs (e.g., summer schools & new certificates), diaspora hubs (North America, EU), humanitarian & reconstruction sectors, and cultural communities (literature, music, film, gaming).

### 2.2 Ukrainian learner personas (2025)
1) **Solidarity connectors** — non‑Ukrainians motivated by solidarity/friendship; want quick wins for communication, social media & culture.  
2) **Diaspora & family** — heritage learners (adults & teens) maintaining ties; want conversation at home, literacy for kids, and identity-affirming content.  
3) **Professionals** — aid workers, journalists, researchers, and business operators; need targeted B1–B2 domains (admin, healthcare, legal, logistics).  
4) **Students** — secondary/university learners (Poland’s L2 option; potential UK GCSE; global summer schools); need structured curricula, exams, and credits.

### 2.3 Jobs‑to‑be‑done (JTBD) for Ukrainian
- **Connect** with Ukrainian speakers (family, friends, community) across borders.  
- **Participate** in civic & cultural life (media, events, volunteering).  
- **Operate** in work/study settings tied to Ukraine (B1–B2 tasks).  
- **Prepare for policy gates** (citizenship/residency language tests).

### 2.4 Product & content opportunities for your site/app
- **Intent‑based onboarding** (single‑select): *connect with family*, *solidarity/community*, *travel*, *work/study*, *culture/media*, *citizenship prep*.  
- **Goal‑tiered tracks:** *Travel basics* → *Social conversation* → *Work/Study B1–B2* → *C1 test prep*.  
- **Speaking confidence path:** Short scripted dialogs → role‑plays → low‑stakes voice messages; address **pronunciation anxiety** explicitly.  
- **Diaspora & family mode:** Dual‑script literacy (Latin transliteration ↔ Cyrillic), intergenerational activities, weekend “heritage class” packs.  
- **Reconstruction & civic packs:** Government forms, housing/healthcare, NGO workflows, public‑service vocabulary.  
- **Culture packs:** Contemporary music/film/news micro‑lessons; creator partnerships.  
- **Assessment & credentials:** CEFR‑aligned checkpoints; practice tests; guidance for **Ukraine’s citizenship exam** and university language placement.  
- **Localizations:** Polish, German, English, and Czech UX to meet the biggest host‑country audiences; community features to pair learners with native speakers.

## Part 3 — Experiments to validate (next 4–6 weeks)
1) **Motivation‑to‑retention A/B:** Ask intent at signup; personalize the first 7 days. Hypothesis: intent‑aligned early lessons → +8–12% Day‑7 retention.  
2) **Speaking‑first onboarding for Ukrainian:** 3× 60‑second voice tasks in week one; measure speaking self‑efficacy and Day‑14 DAU.  
3) **Heritage weekend cohort:** 4‑week cohort for parents/teens; measure completion and NPS vs. self‑paced.  
4) **Work B1 “micro‑credential”:** 6‑hour path + certificate; track conversion to paid or referrals.  
5) **Culture drops:** Weekly creator‑led micro‑lessons; test content virality and session starts.
