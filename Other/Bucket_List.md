# Vision
* What do I want my life to look like in 2 years? 5 years? 10 years? 
    * 2 years - Figure It Out. Know where we want to live while raising our kids. Is it WA? Or CO? or with family? 
    * 5 years - Go Independent. No longer working because I have to, instead working for fun. Establishing the groundwork for what will become life foundation of my childrens' lives. 
    * 10 years - Build a Family Legacy. Creation of trust funds, start a biotech company, own a vacation home - focus is on providing for my family.
    * 30 years - Build an external Legacy. Focus is on providing for the world. 
* Who are 3 people you would help? SCI patients, high school kids (volunteer with sports/church/STEM), my family (siblings & parents). 
* Describe the top two things holding you back from achieving everything above. 
    * Lifestyle (money needs to maintain) - will not compromise on house with yard in a place I want to live in. Need money to pay for a house close to my wife's work, or money to pay for the continue lifestyle (house, car, vacation) while pursuing other passions (own business or a PhD). 
    * Time - I think I have the energy to go after the stuff on the bucket list, that's why I put down a lot that I've already done, to show that I am motivated to check these off. What I don't have is the time. I spend lots of time at work while my child is at daycare, and when she's home it's either playing or doing the logistics (food, prep the car, clean up the house). There's very little time left over to pursue additional goals.
